## Description
A Collision Avoidance System is an advanced driver assistance system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision. In its basic form, a forward collision warning system monitors a vehicle's speed, and the distance between the vehicles, so that it can provide a warning to the driver if the vehicles get too close, potentially helping to avoid a crash.Our project invloves two type of collision avoiding system they are
* LDR based i.e light based
* Ultrasonic based i.e distance based

## Components required
* Breadboard
* HC SR04 - Ultrasonic sensor
* Photoresistor - LDR
* Jumper wires and cables
* Object with light source
* Arduino R3-Compatible board
* LED for checking
## Features
### HC SR04 - Ultrasonic sensor
#### What is Ultrasound?
Ultrasound is high-pitched sound waves with frequencies higher than the audible limit of human hearing.

#### Ultrasonic Frequency Range Spectrum
Human ears can hear sound waves that vibrate in the range from about 20 times a second (a deep rumbling noise) to about 20,000 times a second (a high-pitched whistling). However, ultrasound has a frequency of over 20,000 Hz and is therefore inaudible to humans.

#### HC-SR04 Hardware Overview
At its core, the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic distance sensor consists of two ultrasonic transducers. The one acts as a transmitter which converts electrical signal into 40 KHz ultrasonic sound pulses. The receiver listens for the transmitted pulses. If it receives them it produces an output pulse whose width can be used to determine the distance the pulse travelled. As simple as pie!

The sensor is small, easy to use in any robotics project and offers excellent non-contact range detection between 2 cm to 400 cm (thatâ€™s about an inch to 13 feet) with an accuracy of 3mm. Since it operates on 5 volts, it can be hooked directly to an Arduino or any other 5V logic microcontrollers.
