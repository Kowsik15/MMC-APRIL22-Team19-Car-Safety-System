# Car Safety System

## Description
An automatic braking system is an important part of safety technology for automobiles. It is an advanced system, specifically designed to either prevent possible collision, or reduce speed of the moving vehicle, prior to a collision with another vehicle, pedestrian or an obstacle of some sort.

These systems combine sensors, such as Ldr, infrared or ultrasonic to scan for possible objects in front of the vehicle, and then use brake control to prevent collision if the object is, in fact, detected.

Automatic brakes are one of many car safety features, and are often integrated with other technology, such as pre-collision systems and adaptive cruise control.

Even though each car manufacturer has its own technology when it comes to automatic braking systems, they all use sensory input as a starting point. Depending on the manufacturer, a system uses sensors such as laser, radar, or even video data, to determine if there are any objects in front of the vehicle. For example, the system monitors traffic in front of the vehicle and assesses the possibility of a collision.

If an object is detected, the system continues with direct measurement of sensor data. It determines the distance between the moving vehicle and the object in front of it, and assesses their relative speed, as well. If the system concludes that there is a significant speed difference, i.e. the speed of the vehicle is greater than the speed of the object on its path, it can automatically activate the brakes, in an attempt to prevent the possible collision.

As previously mentioned, each manufacturer uses its own automatic braking system technology, with different sensory input and setup.

Subaru's EyeSight system, for example, uses video input, in the form of two color cameras, mounted at the top of the windshield, to look for contrast with the background and vertical surfaces when scanning the area. The software is then able to recognize different types of images, like pedestrians, motorcycles, and rear ends of other vehicles.

Volvo's City Safety System, on the other hand, uses a combination of a lidar (laser radar), placed in the bumper, and a camera, mounted in the windshield. Lidar can see several hundred yards in front of the car, but it can't determine what it's seeing. That's where the camera steps in, identifying the object and determining if it is a possible problem or not.

Honda's City Brake Active System combines radar sensors and cameras, using the data to determine any possible collision, and warn the driver through the series of visual and audible alerts. If the driver ignores the warnings, the system can take over and automatically apply the brakes. Honda's system can detect pedestrians and slow the vehicle down or stop it entirely if there is a chance of pedestrians being hit.

A Collision Avoidance System is an advanced driver assistance system designed to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision. In its basic form, a forward collision warning system monitors a vehicle's speed, and the distance between the vehicles, so that it can provide a warning to the driver if the vehicles get too close, potentially helping to avoid a crash.Our project invloves two type of collision avoiding system they are

LDR based i.e light based
Ultrasonic based i.e distance based
