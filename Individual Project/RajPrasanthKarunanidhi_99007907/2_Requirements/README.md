## Description
An automatic braking system is an important part of safety technology for automobiles. It is an advanced system, specifically designed to either prevent possible collision, or reduce speed of the moving vehicle, prior to a collision with another vehicle, pedestrian or an obstacle of some sort.

These systems combine sensors, such as Ldr, infrared or ultrasonic to scan for possible objects in front of the vehicle, and then use brake control to prevent collision if the object is, in fact, detected.

### UART ( Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter )
It is a dedicated hardware associated with serial communication. The hardware for UART can be a circuit integrated on the microcontroller or a dedicated IC. This is contrast to SPI or I2C, which are just communication protocols

UART is one of the most simple and most commonly used Serial Communication techniques. Today, UART is being used in many applications like GPS Receivers, Bluetooth Modules, GSM and GPRS Modems, Wireless Communication Systems, RFID based applications etc.

### How UART Works?
In UART Serial Communication, the data is transmitted asynchronously i.e. there is no clock or other timing signal involved between the sender and receiver. Instead of clock signal, UART uses some special bits called Start and Stop bits.

These bits are added to the actual data packet at the beginning and end respectively. These additional bits allows the receiving UART to identify the actual data.

The image above shows a typical UART connection. The transmitting UART receives data from the controlling device through the data bus. The controlling device can be anything like a CPU of a microprocessor or a microcontroller, memory unit like a RAM or ROM, etc. The data received by the transmitting UART from the data bus is parallel data.

To this data, the UART adds Start, Parity and Stop bits in order to convert it into a data packet. The data packet is then converted from parallel to serial with the help of shift register and is transmitted bit – by – bit from the TX pin.

The receiving UART receives this serial data at the RX pin and detects the actual data by identifying the start and stop bits. Parity bit is used to check the integrity of the data.

Up on separating the start, parity and stop bits from the data packet, the data is converted to parallel data with the help of shift register. This parallel data is sent to the controller at the receiving end through a data bus.

## STEPPER
A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is correctly sized to the application in respect to torque and speed

A step motor can be viewed as a synchronous AC motor with the number of poles (on both rotor and stator) increased, taking care that they have no common denominator. Additionally, soft magnetic material with many teeth on the rotor and stator cheaply multiplies the number of poles (reluctance motor). Modern steppers are of hybrid design, having both permanent magnets and soft iron cores.

To achieve full rated torque, the coils in a stepper motor must reach their full rated current during each step. Winding inductance and counter-EMF generated by a moving rotor tend to resist changes in drive current, so that as the motor speeds up, less and less time is spent at full current—thus reducing motor torque. As speeds further increase, the current will not reach the rated value, and eventually the motor will cease to produce torque.
