## Description
An automatic braking system is an important part of safety technology for automobiles. It is an advanced system, specifically designed to either prevent possible collision, or reduce speed of the moving vehicle, prior to a collision with another vehicle, pedestrian or an obstacle of some sort.

These systems combine sensors, such as Ldr, infrared or ultrasonic to scan for possible objects in front of the vehicle, and then use brake control to prevent collision if the object is, in fact, detected.
